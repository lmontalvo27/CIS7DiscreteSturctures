Part 1: Let S = it is sunny, C = camping is fun, H = the homework is
done, and M = mathematics is easy.
Translate: (M → H)∧(S → C)
- If mathematics is easy, then the homework is done and if it is sunny, then camping is fun.

Translate: “Mathematics is easy or camping is fun, as long as it is sunny and the homework is done.”

- (S ^ H)→(M v C)


Part 2:
Use a truth table. Tautology, contradiction, or neither: (¬B → ¬A) → ((¬B → A) → B)

| ¬B | ¬A | B | A | (¬B → ¬A) | ((¬B → A) → B) | (¬B → ¬A) → ((¬B → A) → B) |
|----|:--:|---|---|-----------|----------------|----------------------------|

Part 3: For each of the following pairs of propositions, show that the
two propositions are logically equivalent by finding a chain of equivalences from one
to the other. State which definition or law of logic justifies each equivalence in the
chain.

- (p ∧ q) → r , p → (q → r )
- (p ^ q)' v r <=> p' v (q' v r)  | Implication Law x3
- (p' v q') v r <=> p' v (q' v r) | De Morgan's Law
- (p' v q') v r <=> (p' v q') v r | Associative Law

- (q v r ) → p, (q → p)∧(r → p)
- (q v r)'v p <=> (q' v p)^(r' v p) | Implication Law x3
- (q v r)'v p <=> p v (q' ^ r')     | Distributive Law
- (q v r)'v p <=> p v (q v r)'      | De Morgan's Law
- (q v r)'v p <=> (q v r)'v p       | Commutative Law

Part 4: Let Loves(x,y) mean “x loves y,” Traveler(x) mean “x is a traveler,”
City(x) mean “x is a city,” Lives(x,y) mean “x lives in y.” “z is a resident”
Translate: ∃x∀y∀z(City(x)∧Traveler(y)∧Lives(z,x)) → (Loves(y,x)∧ ¬Loves(z,x))

- In some city all travelers love that city and all residents do not love that city.

Translate: “No traveler loves the city they live in.”

- ∀x∀y(traveler(y)^city(x)^lives(y,x)) → (¬Loves(y,x))


Part 5 Extra Credit: 
Assuming: p → (q ∧r ), s → r , r → p
Prove: s → q
- s   assume
- r   Modus Ponen
- p   
- q ^ r 
- q   
- s → q from steps above.  

Assuming: ¬(r ∨ s), ¬p → s, p → q. 
Prove: q
- r' ^ s' De Morgan's Law
- p → s'  Double Negation Modus Ponen
- p → q
- q
